## 1. Introduction

This report demonstrates the successful implementation of a multithreaded HTTP server capable of handling concurrent requests, serving static files, and implementing various HTTP features including rate limiting and thread-safe request counting.

### Objectives Achieved:
- ✅ Multithreaded HTTP server with concurrent request handling
- ✅ Static file serving with proper MIME types
- ✅ Docker containerization with docker-compose orchestration
- ✅ Thread-safe request counting with race condition demonstration
- ✅ Rate limiting 
- ✅ Directory browsing functionality

│   ├── styles.css
│   └── assets/
└── downloads/             # Client download directory
```

---

## 3. Docker Configuration

### 3.1 Docker Compose Setup

```yaml
services:
  webserver:
    build: .
    container_name: lab2_webserver
    working_dir: /app
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"                 # External:Internal port mapping
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src               # Mount source directory
      - ./multithread.py:/app/multithread.py
    command: python multithread.py /app/src

  client:
    build: .
    container_name: lab2_client
    depends_on:
      - webserver
    working_dir: /app
    volumes:
      - ./downloads:/app/downloads
    entrypoint: ["python", "client.py", "http://webserver:8080", "/app/downloads"]
```

**Key Features:**
- Port mapping allows external access via `localhost:8081`
- Volume mounts enable live code updates without rebuilding
- Client service depends on webserver for proper startup order

### 3.2 Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY multithread.py .
COPY client.py .
COPY src ./src

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["python", "multithread.py", "./src"]
```

**Deployment:** Start with `docker-compose up --build`

## 4. Concurrency Performance Analysis

### 4.1 Objective
Compare single-threaded vs multithreaded server performance handling 10 concurrent requests, each with ~1 second processing time.

### 4.2 Test Methodology

```python
import requests
import time
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

URL = "http://localhost:8080/doc.pdf"

def make_request(i):
    r = requests.get(URL)
    print(f"Request {i} finished with status {r.status_code}")

start = time.time()

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=100) as executor:
    executor.map(make_request, range(100))

end = time.time()
print(f"All 10 requests completed in {end - start:.2f} seconds")
```

### 4.3 Results

**Screenshot:**  
![img_5.png](screenshots/img_5.png)

*Figure 2: Concurrent request handling performance comparison*

| Server Type | Total Time | Avg per Request | Speedup |
|------------|------------|----------------|---------|
| Single-threaded | ~10.2s     | ~1.02s | 1x      |
| Multi-threaded | ~2.8s      | ~1.01s | **~5x** |

**Analysis:** The multithreaded implementation achieves near-linear speedup, demonstrating effective concurrent request handling. The slight overhead is due to thread creation and synchronization costs.

## 5. Thread-Safe Request Counting

### 5.1 Implementation

Two counters were implemented to demonstrate race condition hazards and their mitigation:

```python
import threading
import time

# Global state
request_counts_naive = {}      # Unprotected counter
request_counts_safe = {}       # Lock-protected counter
request_counts_lock = threading.Lock()

# Inside request handler:
def handle_request(fs_path):
    if os.path.exists(fs_path):
        # NAIVE (race-prone): Read-modify-write without protection
        if fs_path not in request_counts_naive:
            request_counts_naive[fs_path] = 0
        temp = request_counts_naive[fs_path]
        time.sleep(0.01)  # Amplify race window
        request_counts_naive[fs_path] = temp + 1
        
        # THREAD-SAFE: Atomic update with lock
        with request_counts_lock:
            if fs_path not in request_counts_safe:
                request_counts_safe[fs_path] = 0
            request_counts_safe[fs_path] += 1
```

### 5.2 Race Condition Demonstration

**Before concurrent requests:**  
![img_1.png](screenshots/img_1.png)

*Figure 3: Initial counter state*

**After 100 concurrent requests to the same file:**  
![img_2.png](screenshots/img_2.png)

*Figure 4: Counter comparison showing race condition impact*

| Counter Type | Expected | Actual | Error Rate |
|-------------|----------|--------|------------|
| Naive | 100 | 22     | 78% loss   |
| Thread-safe | 100 | 100    | 0% loss    |

**Key Insight:** The naive counter exhibits classic lost-update anomaly where multiple threads read the same value before any write, causing count loss. The `time.sleep(0.01)` deliberately widens the race window for demonstration purposes.

## 6. Rate Limiting Implementation

### 6.1 Algorithm: Sliding Window

```python
import time
import threading

# Configuration
RATE_LIMIT = 5           # Maximum requests
WINDOW_SECONDS = 1       # Per time window

# State
rate_limits = {}         # client_ip -> [timestamps]
rate_lock = threading.Lock()

def is_rate_limited(client_ip):
    """
    Sliding window rate limiter.
    Returns True if client exceeded limit.
    """
    current_time = time.time()
    
    with rate_lock:
        if client_ip not in rate_limits:
            rate_limits[client_ip] = []
        
        # Expire old timestamps outside window
        rate_limits[client_ip] = [
            ts for ts in rate_limits[client_ip] 
            if current_time - ts < WINDOW_SECONDS
        ]
        
        # Check limit
        if len(rate_limits[client_ip]) >= RATE_LIMIT:
            return True
        
        # Record this request
        rate_limits[client_ip].append(current_time)
        return False

# In request handler:
if is_rate_limited(client_address[0]):
    send_response(429, "Too Many Requests")
    return
```

### 6.2 Testing

**Exceeding rate limit (>5 req/sec):**  
![img_4.png](screenshots/img_4.png)

**Within rate limit (≤5 req/sec):**
